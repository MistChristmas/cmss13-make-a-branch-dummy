# About the pull request

<!-- Remove this text and explain what the purpose of your PR is.

Mention if you have tested your changes. If you changed a map, make sure you used the mapmerge tool.
If this addresses a reported issue, you can include "Fixes #12345" to link the PR to the corresponding Issue number #12345.
For multiple issues you must include the "Fixes" keyword for each, e.g. "Fixes #12345, Fixes #12346, Fixes #12347". You cannot use multiple issue numbers with only one keyword.

Remember: something that is self-evident to you might not be to others. Explain your rationale fully, even if you feel it goes without saying. -->

# Explain why it's good for the game

<!-- Please add a short description of why you think these changes would benefit the game. If you can't justify it in words, it might not be worth adding, and may discourage maintainers from reviewing or merging your PR. This section is not strictly required for (non-controversial) fix PRs or backend PRs. -->


# Testing Photographs and Procedure
<!-- Include any screenshots/videos/debugging steps of the modified code functioning successfully, ideally including edge cases. -->

<!-- !! If you are modifying sprites, you **must** include one or more in-game screenshots or videos of the new sprites. !! -->

# Changelog

<!-- If your PR modifies aspects of the game that can be concretely observed by players or admins you should add a changelog. If your change does NOT meet this description, remove this section. Be sure to properly label your changes in the changelog. Please note that maintainers freely reserve the right to remove and add tags should they deem it appropriate. You can attempt to finagle the system all you want, but it's best to shoot for clear communication right off the bat. -->
<!-- If you add a name after the ':cl', that name will be used in the changelog. You must add your CKEY after the CL if your GitHub name doesn't match. Maintainers freely reserve the right to remove and add tags should they deem it appropriate. -->
